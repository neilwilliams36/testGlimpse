Set up

Make sure that you have Python 2.7 installed


Navigate to this folder

Start the Server, this will take up one bash tab or dos window
Note after repeated tests and server restarts the port may become blocked.
If this happens restart the computer OR change the port number in both
the server file and the test file.

python server.py

Run the test suit in another tab or dos window

python test.py

To see the tests that have been run, run the test suit in verbose mode

python test.py -v
